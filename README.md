## Reflection
### Assignment 1
From this assignment, I learnt about the ICT Industry and job scope of different position in a ICT company. It is a great information and guidance for the us, students to have a clearer vision of their furute path and be prepared. Speakers have been sharing about their experiences or tips for learning or getting a job and also working in the industry. This industrial talk has encouraged me to be a more proactive learning person as told by Mr Yee, the CTO of the company, ICT industry is changing rapidly everyday, all we can do is keep learning.
### Assignment 2
This industrial visit provided valuable insights for us about the technologies in real-life application. We are given chance to interact with professionals and get more understanding about the software or system used by developers. It was a fun and interesting visit!
### Assignment 3
This talk inspired me to realize that success in computer science is not just about paper qualifications, but also practical experience and the right mindset. During my university years, I aim to fully utilize available resources and opportunities to grow personally and professionally. I plan to develop soft skills and practical experience through projects, internships, and competitions. Additionally, I will continuously improve my technical skills by learning programming tools and staying updated with new technologies and industry trends. I hope to build a strong foundation for success in computer science over the next four years and beyond.
### Assignment 4
This industrial visit provided valuable insights into how innovation enhances human life in many aspects. We are able to reduce risk and build advancements beyond our natural abilities as demonstrated by Digital Twin Technology. Furthermore, innovation addresses resource limitations and lowers the cost of trial and error. We can safely explore possibilities and feasibility. It allows us to prepare thoroughly for real-world operations and gain learning opportunities that might be challenging to achieve in real-world settings.
